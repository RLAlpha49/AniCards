# TODO List

- If the border color cannot use a gradient, the option to select a gradient should be removed.
- All the progress bars for gradient selections do not extend the full progress bar width and have a small gap on both sides.
- What do the inputs alongside the progress bars for gradients steps do. It is unintuitive to the user and adding explanation text would help for explaining how gradients work.
- when selecting a color preset which uses gradients, it does not change the color modes to gradient or solid correctly.
- The color presets should have 2 views. One for solid colors and one for gradients. The views should further split up by light and dark themes.
- Remove the default color preset from settings. When selecting colors for the cards it should save the current colors so they can be loaded as the default next time. Essentially making the users current colors the default colors. If they relate to a preset, the preset name should be saved as well. Otherwise it should be saved as "custom".
- Create gradient versions of AniList Dark and Light color presets.
- Create light verson gradient as there are currently none.
