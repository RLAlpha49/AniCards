# TODO List

- When typing a position percentage, after typing once it unfocuses the input field and seems to focus the dialog instead.
- Do not show the show more button if there is no more color presets to show. For example if i filter by gradient and light mode there is 9 total presets. It still shows the show more color presets button. But dissapears when pressing it once.
- Whenever the sidebar is toggled it should update the sidebarDefaultOpen setting to reflect the new state.
- SVG's on the user page should always be force loaded and cache ignored so any changes to the cards are reflected immediately.
- Add a setting for the card border radius for the card generator.
- Whenever a card is displayed anywhere (user page, preview, generator, floating cards, etc) it should check its border radius and make sure the container has the same border radius so the border corners do not get cut off.
