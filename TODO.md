# TODO List

- When typing a position percentage, after typing once it unfocuses the input field and seems to focus the dialog instead.
- Do not show the show more button if there is no more color presets to show.
- When saving the cards in the database it should only overwrite the specific card instead of the whole array of cards.
- When generating cards it should go to the user page how you go to the user page when searching a user and not add the parameters of the cards to the URL.
- Remove comments and sort color presets in constants.ts
