# Running the Application

You can start the application by running either of the following commands:

`python main.py`

or

`python wrapper.py`

Running main.py will start the application directly.

Running wrapper.py will also start the application, but in addition, it provides control commands for the server. You can use commands like "restart", "stop", "start", "pull", and "close" to control the server's operation.

The application will be available at [http://localhost:5000](https://vscode-file/vscode-app/c:/Program%20Files/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html).
