## Markdown Content Rules

The following markdown content rules are enforced in the validators:

1. **Headings**: Use appropriate heading levels (H2, H3, etc.) to structure your content. Prefer `##`/`###` for article sections; use `#` (H1) only for top-level documents like README pages.
2. **Lists**: Use bullet points or numbered lists for lists. Ensure proper indentation and spacing.
3. **Code Blocks**: Use fenced code blocks for code snippets. Specify the language for syntax highlighting.
4. **Links**: Use proper markdown syntax for links. Ensure that links are valid and accessible.
5. **Images**: Use proper markdown syntax for images. Include alt text for accessibility.
6. **Tables**: Use markdown tables for tabular data. Ensure proper formatting and alignment.
7. **Line Length**: Limit line length to 120 characters for readability.
8. **Whitespace**: Use appropriate whitespace to separate sections and improve readability.
9. **Front Matter**: Include YAML front matter at the beginning of the file with required metadata fields.

## Formatting and Structure

Follow these guidelines for formatting and structuring your markdown content:

- **Headings**: Use `##` for H2 and `###` for H3. Ensure that headings are used in a hierarchical manner. Recommend restructuring if content includes H4, and more strongly recommend for H5.
- **Lists**: Use `-` for bullet points and `1.` for numbered lists. Indent nested lists with two spaces.
- **Code Blocks**: Use triple backticks (`) to create fenced code blocks. Specify the language after the opening backticks for syntax highlighting (e.g., `csharp).
- **Links**: Use `[link text](URL)` for links. Ensure that the link text is descriptive and the URL is valid.
- **Images**: Use `![alt text](image URL)` for images. Include a brief description of the image in the alt text.
- **Tables**: Use `|` to create tables. Ensure that columns are properly aligned and headers are included.
- **Line Length**: Break lines at ~120 characters to improve readability. Use soft line breaks for long paragraphs.
- **Whitespace**: Use blank lines to separate sections and improve readability. Avoid excessive whitespace.

-- **Front Matter**: Include the following fields in the YAML front matter:
